# Minimal Prompt

> Better, Faster, Stronger Zsh prompt

## Overview

Who knew a whole Zsh theme could be specified through the prompt? Clean, simple and performant!

### Lightweight and Dependency Free 
* Get `git` info when and where it matters.
* Remove Zsh dependency bloat.

## Installation
1. Add the folder path in your fpath (in your `zshrc`): `fpath=(/the/folder/where/there/is/the/prompt $fpath)`
2. Autoload it in your `zshrc`: `autoload -Uz prompt_setup && prompt_setup`
